# ALU Scripting

## Description
This repository contains projects completed as part of the **ALU Scripting Curriculum**.  
The goal of these projects is to build strong foundations in scripting and automation using languages such as **Python** and **Ruby**.  

Each directory in this repository focuses on a specific concept - from working with **APIs** to mastering **Regular Expressions**- helpi develop practical skills for problem-solving and software development.

## Project Directories

### 1. [`api_advanced/`](./api_advanced)
**Language:** Python  
**Focus:** Advanced API usage and data manipulation  

This project explores working with the **Reddit API** using the `requests` module in Python.  
Learn to:
- Read and understand API documentation  
- Make HTTP requests and parse JSON responses  
- Handle pagination and rate limits  
- Use recursion to collect API data  
- Sort and process information programmatically  

**Key topics:** REST APIs, JSON parsing, recursion, sorting, pagination.

### 2. [`regular_expressions/`](./regular_expressions)
**Language:** Ruby  
**Focus:** Pattern matching and text processing  

This project focuses on mastering **Regular Expressions (Regex)** using Ruby's **Oniguruma** regex library
Learn to:
- Build regex patterns to match specific text  
- Use repetition quantifiers and anchors  
- Validate and filter data like phone numbers or uppercase words  
- Understand greedy vs. lazy matching  

**Key topics:** Regex syntax, pattern matching, text parsing, automation.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python 3.4.3, Ruby 2.1.5  
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 14.04 LTS  
- **Editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`

## General Requirements
- All files must be **executable**
- Each file should end with a **new line**
- Mandatory **README.md** in every project directory
- Code should be clean, readable, and well-documented
- Use of proper **shebang lines**:
  - Python: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Ruby: `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`
